Contains a few commands
- AssemblyCode (should take a mnemonic and return the corresponding opcode)
- StringBreaker (should take a string and split it at given symbols)
- FileOpener (should take user input of input and output files, read from input file
and print the contents to screen as well as output file)

For StringBreaker the string and symbols to split on must be changed within the
code am working on changing this to user input.

AssemblyCode currently only takes one mnemonic but will be changed to run through
multiple in the future.
